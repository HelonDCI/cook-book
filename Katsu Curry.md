# For the sauce:
--------------

-   2 onions, sliced

-   5 garlic cloves, crushed

-   2 carrots, grated

-   1 level tbsp mild curry powder*

-   1 tbsp tomato purée

-   600ml hot chicken stock

-   Pinch of sweetener granules

# Method
------

1.  Preheat your oven to 200°C/fan 180°C/gas 6 and line a large baking sheet with non-stick baking paper.

2.  Put the chicken breasts between sheets of cling film and bash with a wooden mallet or rolling pin until slightly flattened. Discard the cling film and season the chicken lightly.

3.  Put the bread in a food processor, blitz to fine crumbs and tip into a wide, shallow bowl. Stir in the lemon zest. Put the eggs in another wide, shallow bowl.

4.  Dip each chicken breast first in the egg and then the breadcrumbs. Put them on the baking sheet, drizzle over any extra egg and spray with low-calorie cooking spray. Set aside.

5.  To make the sauce, spray a large non-stick frying pan with low-calorie cooking spray and put it over a medium heat. Stir-fry the onions for 4-5 minutes, then add the garlic and carrots. Stir-fry for 4-5 minutes, then add the curry powder, tomato purée, stock, sweetener and soy sauce. Bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 minutes or until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally.

6.  At the same time, put the chicken in the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until cooked through and lightly golden. Slice each chicken breast into thick strips.

7.  Blitz the sauce using a stick blender or food processor and season to taste (you can keep the sauce chunky if you prefer but it's more authentic if you give it a good blitz). Spoon the sauce onto 4 plates and top with 1 sliced chicken breast per person.

8.  Sprinkle with the spring onion and chilli, and serve hot with the rice.
