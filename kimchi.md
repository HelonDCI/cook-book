**Step 1: Gather the Ingredients**

    1 medium-sized Napa cabbage
    1/4 cup sea salt or kosher salt
    4 cups water
    1 tablespoon grated ginger
    3 cloves garlic, minced
    2 tablespoons Korean red pepper flakes (gochugaru)
    2 teaspoons granulated sugar
    4 green onions, chopped
    2 carrots, julienned
    Optional: radish, daikon, or other vegetables for additional flavor and texture

**Step 2: Prepare the Cabbage**

    Cut the Napa cabbage lengthwise into quarters, then remove the core.
    Rinse the cabbage quarters under cold water.
    In a large bowl, dissolve the salt in water to create a brine.
    Submerge the cabbage quarters in the brine, making sure they are fully covered.
    Place a plate or a weight on top of the cabbage to keep it submerged.
    Let the cabbage soak in the brine for about 2 hours, turning it occasionally.

**Step 3: Make the Kimchi Paste**

    In a separate bowl, combine the grated ginger, minced garlic, Korean red pepper flakes, and sugar. Mix well to form a paste.
    Add the chopped green onions and julienned carrots to the paste and mix everything together.

**Step 4: Rinse and Drain the Cabbage**

    After 2 hours, rinse the cabbage quarters under cold water to remove excess salt.
    Gently squeeze out the excess water and let them drain in a colander for about 15-20 minutes.

**Step 5: Stuff the Cabbage with the Kimchi Paste**

    Take each cabbage quarter and spread the kimchi paste mixture between the leaves, ensuring they are evenly coated.
    If desired, add additional vegetables such as radish or daikon alongside the paste for added flavor and crunch.

**Step 6: Ferment the Kimchi**

    Place the kimchi-filled cabbage quarters into a clean glass jar, pressing them down firmly.
    Leave about an inch of headspace at the top of the jar.
    Close the jar tightly and let it sit at room temperature for 1-2 days to initiate the fermentation process.
    After this initial fermentation period, transfer the jar to the refrigerator to continue fermenting slowly. Kimchi can be consumed immediately, but the flavors will develop further with time.

**Step 7: Enjoy!**

    Kimchi can be enjoyed as a side dish, added to stir-fries, soups, or used as a topping for various dishes.
    Remember to keep the jar tightly sealed and refrigerated to prolong its shelf life.

That's it! You have successfully made kimchi. Enjoy your homemade fermented delight!
