# Here's a simple recipe for delicious homemade pizza:
## Ingredients:

- 2 1/4 cups of flour
- 1 teaspoon of dry yeast
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- 1 teaspoon of sugar
- 3/4 cup of warm water
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil

## Instructions:

In a large bowl, mix together the flour, dry yeast, salt, and sugar. Stir the ingredients well.

In a smaller bowl, mix the warm water and olive oil.

Slowly pour the water and oil mixture into the dry ingredients. Stir until the dough begins to form.

Transfer the dough onto a floured surface and knead for 5-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.

Return the dough to the bowl, cover it with a cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it doubles in size.

**Preheat the oven to 220°C (425°F).**

Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air. Then, roll it out to your desired thickness for the pizza.

Place the dough on a pizza stone or baking sheet.

_Now, you can add your favorite toppings such as tomato sauce, cheese, vegetables, and meats. Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly._
